# Moving Snowman 
This program, developed using C++, creates an interactive 3D scene featuring a charming snowman constructed from cubes and spheres, complemented by vibrant geometric shapes like triangles and squares. Users can manipulate the scene through keyboard inputs, and the snowman exhibits smooth, automatic movement back and forth.   
  
 
# Upon running the program, users will see:

- A vibrant 3D scene with a green floor.
- A colorful snowman made up of three cubes (for the body, chest, and head), two spheres (for the eyes), and a cone (for the nose), with arms represented by cones.
- Rotating square and triangle shapes.
- The snowman moving back and forth along the X-axis, providing a simple animation effect.
- User interaction capabilities through keyboard inputs to shift the scene in multiple directions.
# Visual and Functional Aspects
## Colors:
- The snowman is primarily white, adorned with red for the chest, blue for the head, and black for the eyes and arms.
## Interaction:
- Users can manipulate the scene’s view and control the snowman’s position using keyboard commands.
## Animation: 
- The program continuously refreshes the animation, imparting a dynamic quality to the scene.

# Conclusion
This project illustrates fundamental concepts of 3D graphics using C++ and OpenGL, including shape rendering, animation, and user interaction, serving as an introductory experience in creating engaging 3D environments.
